    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large aubergines</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed with salt</li>
        <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp creamy yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grill the aubergines, rotating from time to time. Cook till charred and blistered.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, strip off the blackened skin. Roughly chop the soft inner flesh and put in a colander, allowing any bitter juices to drain away.</li>
        <li> In a bowl, combine the aubergine, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and yogurt. Season with salt and pepper and mash into the consistency of a purée. You could use the food processor if you prefer a smoother consistency.  Refrigerate until required but ideally serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
